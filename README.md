xombrero2
=========

This will be a replacement for me for the
[https://github.com/conformal/xombrero](xombrero) browser, but written
in Go and using WebKit2.

This is not a 1:1 port of xombrero to Go, and may not be the browser
you always wanted.  I will drop the xombrero name if it turns out
different enough.
